# MLcomparison
In the example below 6 different algorithms are compared:

Logistic Regression<br /> 
Linear Discriminant Analysis<br /> 
K-Nearest Neighbors<br /> 
Classification and Regression Trees<br /> 
Naive Bayes<br /> 
Support Vector Machines<br /> 

The 10-fold cross validation procedure is used to evaluate each algorithm, importantly configured with the same random seed to ensure that the same splits to the training data are performed and that each algorithms is evaluated in precisely the same way.

LR: 0.769515 (0.048411)<br /> 
LDA: 0.773462 (0.051592)<br /> 
KNN: 0.726555 (0.061821)<br /> 
CART: 0.695232 (0.062517)<br /> 
NB: 0.755178 (0.042766)<br /> 
SVM: 0.651025 (0.072141)<br />
